# API-Finder
A fun project I made an MVP for in a day for our hack day at the School of Applied Technology Javascript bootcamp. Still in development.

Yet to do
  Small fixing
  - Fix the table pagination buttons to be disabled if not usable. Ex, back button should be greyed out when on page one.

  Larger tasks
  - Add a login functionality, and make favorites specific to user.
  - Implement logic so that when you make a search and an already favorited api shows up, it displays as favorited.
  
  Bugfixes
  - Fix the bug where server hangs if api-response is empty on complex searches.
  - Fix the bug where if you add an api to favorites, and make another search, it displays false-favorites in the table. 
    (On the same index as the previously favorited api)
